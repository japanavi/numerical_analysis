# Numerical Analysis

A collection of numerical analysis algorithims I wrote as part of the Numerical Analysis I (MATH-M470) course taught at Indiana University Bloomington in 2018.

All algorithms are adapted from the pseudo-code written in the textbook [Numerical Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Analysis-Richard-L-Burden/dp/1305253663) (10E), by Richard L. Burden, Douglas J. Faires, & Annette M. Burden.

TO-DO:  
* Finish Doc-strings for all functions
* Add citiations to functions to be able to find them in the book
